                <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech
                started with a degree in journalism. As I started aharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I
                could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific
                needs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="half-width">
              <div class="about p">
                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I
                realized I found something that gave me the freedome & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made
                a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean,
                elegant code.</p>
